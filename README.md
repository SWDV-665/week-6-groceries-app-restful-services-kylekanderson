### Answers to submission questions

How many hours do you estimate you used completing this assignment?
I estimate that I spent about 5 hours completing this assignment

What was easiest for you when completing this assignment?
Because I had already implemented a RESTful service layer and CRUD operations in my final project, I was able to refer to that implementation to help with completing this assignment this week.

What was the most difficult challenge you experienced when completing this assignment?
Observables and the RXJS library are a difficult concept to understand. I struggled with implementing those concepts both in my final project and in the assignment this week.
